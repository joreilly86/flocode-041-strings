# Flocode Newsletter #041 - Python Essentials: Strings

This repository supports Flocode Newsletter #041, focusing on Python's string data type and its applications in engineering contexts.

## Contents

- `strings_tutorial.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with string manipulation examples and exercises
- `borehole_data.xlsx`: Synthetic borehole data for practical examples
- `clean_up.py`: Python script demonstrating data cleaning techniques using strings

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flocode-041-strings.git
   cd flocode-041-strings

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install dependencies:
   - Using `requirements.txt`:

     pip install -r requirements.txt

   - Using `pyproject.toml` (requires `pip` >= 21.0):

     pip install .

    > ðŸ“¢ **Tip:** I've been loving [uv](https://astral.sh/blog/uv) as my package and environment manager. It's incredibly fast and efficient. If you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend giving it a go. It's on track to replace Poetry in my toolkit.


## Usage

- Open `strings_tutorial.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to follow the tutorial
- Run `clean_up.py` to see string-based data cleaning in action:

  python clean_up.py
